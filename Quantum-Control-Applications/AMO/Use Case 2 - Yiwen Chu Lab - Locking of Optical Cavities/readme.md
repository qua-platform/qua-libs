## Context and PDH Locking

Optomechanical experiments such as the one in Yiwen Chu's group have been shown to be a promising platform for several quantum technologies such as quantum transducers [1], entanglement of lasers [2], and as quantum memory [3]. These technologies put stringent requirements on the classical laser phase noise of the source laser [4], which is typically exceeded by common laser sources such as diode lasers. On one side, the laser frequency noise needs to be kept low to allow the laser to cool a resolved-sideband mechanical resonator to its quantum ground state, i.e., a mean phonon occupation below 1. On the other hand, excess noise of the readout laser can perturb the optomechanical sidebands and thus influence sideband thermometry measurements. Therefore, optical filter cavities, potentially several cascaded filter cavities [5], are implemented in the setup. Sam Pautrel and Maxwell Drimmer in the group of Yiwen Chu have found a convenient solution to PDH lock several optical cavities in series using the OPX that is described further below, and the scripts are included in these folders.

**Intro to PDH Locking**

Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) locking is a widely-used technique for stabilizing the frequency of a laser to a reference cavity [6]. By modulating the phase of the laser and analyzing the reflected signal, an error signal is generated, which can be used to correct the laser frequency. This method is crucial for maintaining the stability needed for high-precision optical experiments.

## Setup

The corresponding experimental setup is as follows (cf. figure below):
* Each cavity uses one analog output to drive their respective piezo-electric motor controller (AO 6, 7 & 8).
* Another analog output is used to provide the Pound-Drever-Hall modulation signal to the phase modulator (AO 6).
* One analog input is connected to an RF switch which allows probing the optical signal acquired by a photodiode placed after each cavity (AI 2). 
* The state of the RF switch (3 pins) is controlled by three digital markers provided by three OPX digital outputs (DO 7-9).
* Four additional digital markers are used to control the optical switches rerouting the light in different sections of the full setup not part of the lock setup (DO 1-4).
* Other channels are used for qubit control and readout, AOM drive, and optical switches.

## Detailed Description of Files and Functions
### The Filter Cavities Functions Library
* `PID_derivation`: Derives PID/correction signal `corr` based on the `input_signal`, `target` value, and the PID gains. Bitshift is being used as FPGA-efficient division.

```python
def PID_derivation(input_signal,corr,error,integrator_error,derivative_error,old_error, bitshift_scale_factor, gain_P, gain_I, gain_D, alpha, target):
    # calculate the error
    assign(error, (target - input_signal) << bitshift_scale_factor) #bitshift the error
    # calculate the integrator error with exponentially decreasing weights with coefficient alpha, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing
    assign(integrator_error, (1.0 - alpha) * integrator_error + alpha * error)
    # calculate the derivative error
    assign(derivative_error, old_error - error)
    # save old error to be error
    assign(old_error, error)

    assign(corr, gain_P * error + gain_I * integrator_error + gain_D * derivative_error)
    return(corr)
```

* `opticalswitches_control`: Controls an optical switch not part of the optical cavity setup. The switch is controlled by playing digital markers from the OPX.
* `RFswitch_control`: Selects the photodiode signal routet to the OPX input by sending a digital marker signal to an SP8T RF switch.
* `measure_macro`: Measures the photodiode signal and modulates the phase of the PDH signal, playing digital pulses at the same time as the PDH modulator drive pulse. It handles both DC and AC measurements and can save the data if needed.

```python
def measure_macro(RFconfig,single_shot_DC_st,single_shot_AC_st,I,Q,savedata,N_avg=1,angle=0.0):
    '''Measure macro used in FastLock. Plays the digital pulses at the same time as the PDH modulator drive pulse.
    single_shot_DC/AC are not arguments, they're local variables declared inside this function.'''
    n_avg = declare(int)
    single_shot_DC = declare(fixed)
    single_shot_AC = declare(fixed)
    RFconfig_number=declare(int,value=RFswitch_lookup[RFconfig])
    opticalconfig_number=declare(int,value=opticalswitches_lookup["0110"]) # Only OS2 and OS3 are ON

    # assign(cavity_number,RFswitch_lookup[cavity])
    with for_(n_avg, 0, n_avg<N_avg, n_avg+1):
        # Ensure that the two digital oscillators will start with the same phase
        reset_phase("phase_modulator")
        reset_phase("detector_AC")
        # Adjust the phase delay between the two
        # frame_rotation_2pi(angle, "detector_AC")
        frame_rotation_2pi(angle, "phase_modulator")
        # Sync all the elements
        align() # Wait for previous block of pulses (from previous loop iteration) to be finished
        
        # Select which photodiode signal is sent to the OPX input, using SP8T RF swich
        RFswitch_control(RFconfig_number)
        # Configure laser path with optical switches
        opticalswitches_control(opticalconfig_number)
        # Play the PDH sideband
        play("cw", "phase_modulator")
        # Measure and integrate the signal received by the detector --> DC measurement
        measure("readout", "detector_DC", None, integration.full("constant", single_shot_DC, "out1"))
        # Measure and demodulate the signal received by the detector --> AC measurement sqrt(I**2 + Q**2)
        measure("readout", "detector_AC", None, demod.full("constant", I, "out1"), demod.full("constant", Q, "out1"))
        assign(single_shot_AC, I)
        reset_frame("phase_modulator") #reset the phase to undo the angle rotation above

    with if_(savedata==True):
        save(single_shot_DC, single_shot_DC_st)
        save(single_shot_AC, single_shot_AC_st)
        
    return(single_shot_AC)
```

* `measure_macro_slowlock`: Measures and integrates signals used in the slow lock without saving data.
* `slowLock`: Performs a slow lock by measuring the starting point and sweeping the offset until the AC signal changes sign significantly. Utilizes `measure_macro_slowlock`.
* `fastLock`: Engages PID on the error signal from the low-frequency PDH, adjusting the offset in real-time to maintain lock. Utilizes `measure_macro`.

```python
def fastLock(cavity,single_shot_DC_st,single_shot_AC_st,I,Q,offset_opti,correction,error,int_error,der_error,old_error,gain_P_qua,gain_I_qua,gain_D_qua,lock_time,alpha_qua,target_qua=0.0,bitshift_scale_factor_qua=3,savedata=True):
    '''Engages PID on error signal from low freq PDH'''
    n_fastlock_repeat = declare(int)
    N_fastlock_repeat = declare(int)
    assign(N_fastlock_repeat, int(lock_time*1e9 / readout_len))
    # play("offset" * amp(offset_opti), cavity) #Start at the previous setpoint
    # wait(pause_time)
    with for_(n_fastlock_repeat, 0, n_fastlock_repeat < N_fastlock_repeat, n_fastlock_repeat + 1):
        single_shot_AC=measure_macro(cavity,single_shot_DC_st,single_shot_AC_st,I,Q,savedata)
        # single_shot_AC=measure_macro_withavg(cavity,single_shot_DC_st,single_shot_AC_st,I,Q,savedata)
        correction= PID_derivation(single_shot_AC,correction,error,int_error,der_error,old_error, bitshift_scale_factor_qua, gain_P_qua, gain_I_qua, gain_D_qua, alpha_qua, target_qua)
        assign(offset_opti, offset_opti+correction)
        play("offset" * amp(correction * 4), cavity) #sticky element, adds correction to previous value
```

* `fullock`: Uses `fastLock` to lock three cavities in series, sequentially locking each cavity to its target value.

### The Configuration File Elements
* `filter_cavity_1`, `filter_cavity_2`, and `filter_cavity_3`: Each cavity necessitates one analog output to drive their respective piezo-electric motor controller (AO 6, 7 & 10).
* `phase_modulator`: Another analog output is used to provide the Pound-Drever-Hall modulation signal to the phase modulator (AO 8).
* One analog input is connected to an RF switch which allows probing the optical signal acquired by a photodiode placed after each cavity (AI 1). 
* `RFswitch_pin0`, `RFswitch_pin1`, and `RFswitch_pin2`: The state of the RF switch (3 pins) is controlled by three digital markers provided by three OPX digital outputs (DO 7-9).
* Other channels are used for qubit control and readout, AOM drive, and optical switches.

### The Cavity Monitoring File
This script can be used to characterize the quality of the lock. This has also been used to measure the data presented in the figures above. It PID locks a single optical cavity and alternates `N_outer_repeat` times between lock and out of lock. The DC and AC signal as well as the lock paramters are saved in a `.npz` file to be plotted using [Cavity Lock Data Analysis.ipynb](QuantumMachine_UserCase/QuantumMachine_UserCase/Cavity%20Lock%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb).

## Results

The figure below shows results of a lock of a single optical cavity using the [Cavity monitoring QUA script](QuantumMachine_UserCase/QuantumMachine_UserCase/Cavity_monitoring_QUA.py). When switching between enabled and disabled PID lock, the program is able to recapture the drifting error signal. This can be seen both in the AC and DC signal.

Furthermore, the FFT in the figure below allows assessing the quality of the lock. This is practical when the integrator gain of the PID is being fine-tuned to dampen self-oscillations of the PID lock.
