"""
        CHARGE SENSOR GATE SWEEP with an external DC source
Here the voltage biasing the sensor gate is provided and being swept by an external DC source connected to the DC line
of the bias-tee.
The OPX is simply measuring, either via dc current sensing or RF reflectometry, the response of the sensor dot.

A single point averaging is performed (averaging on the most inner loop) and the data is extracted while the program is
running.

Prerequisites:
    - Connect one the DC line of the bias-tee connected to the sensor dot to one OPX channel.
    - Setting the parameters of the external DC source using its driver if needed.

Before proceeding to the next node:
    - Update the config with the optimal sensing point.
