        Pauli Spin Blockade search
The goal of the script is to find the PSB region according to the protocol described in Nano Letters 2020 20 (2), 947-952.
To do so, the charge stability map is acquired by scanning the voltages provided by the QDAC2,
to the DC part of the bias-tees connected to the plunger gates, while 2 OPX channels are stepping the voltages on the fast
lines of the bias-tees to navigate through the triangle in voltage space (empty - random initialization - measurement).

Depending on the cut-off frequency of the bias-tee, it may be necessary to adjust the barycenter (voltage offset) of each
triangle so that the fast line of the bias-tees sees zero voltage in average. Otherwise, the high-pass filtering effect
of the bias-tee will distort the fast pulses over time. A function has been written for this.

In the current implementation, the OPX is also measuring (either with DC current sensing or RF-reflectometry) during the
readout window (last segment of the triangle).
A single-point averaging is performed and the data is extracted while the program is running to display the results line-by-line.

Prerequisites:
    - Readout calibration (resonance frequency for RF reflectometry and sensor operating point for DC current sensing).
    - Setting the parameters of the QDAC2 and preloading the two voltages lists for the slow and fast axes.
    - Connect the two plunger gates (DC line of the bias-tee) to the QDAC2 and two digital markers from the OPX to the
      QDAC2 external trigger ports.
    - Connect the OPX to the fast line of the plunger gates for playing the triangle pulse sequence.

Before proceeding to the next node:
    - Identify the PSB region and update the config.
