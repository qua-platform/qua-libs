        CHARGE STABILITY MAP - fast and slow axes: QDAC2 set to trigger mode
The goal of the script is to acquire the charge stability map.
Here two channels of the QDAC2 are parametrized to step though two preloaded voltage lists on the event of two digital
markers provided by the OPX (connected to ext1 and ext2). This method allows the fast acquisition of a 2D voltage map
and the data can be fetched from the OPX in real time to enable live plotting.
The speed can also be further improved by removing the live plotting and increasing the QDAC2 bandwidth.

The QUA program consists in sending the triggers to the QDAC2 to increment the voltages and measure the charge of the dot
either via dc current sensing or RF reflectometry.
On top of the DC voltage sweeps, the OPX can output a continuous square wave (Coulomb pulse) through the AC line of the
bias-tee. This allows to check the coupling of the fast line to the sample and measure the lever arms between the DC and
AC lines.

A global average is performed (averaging on the most outer loop) and the data is extracted while the program is running
to display the full charge stability map with increasing SNR.

Prerequisites:
    - Readout calibration (resonance frequency for RF reflectometry and sensor operating point for DC current sensing).
    - Setting the parameters of the QDAC2 and preloading the two voltages lists for the slow and fast axes.
    - Connect the two plunger gates (DC line of the bias-tee) to the QDAC2 and two digital markers from the OPX to the
      QDAC2 external trigger ports.
    - (optional) Connect the OPX to the fast line of the plunger gates for playing the Coulomb pulse and calibrate the
      lever arm.

Before proceeding to the next node:
    - Identify the different charge occupation regions.
    - Update the config with the lever-arms.
