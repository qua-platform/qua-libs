# Exchange-only qubit with RF-reflectometry or DC current sensing.

## Experimental setup and context

These files showcase various experiments that can be done on an exchange-only qubit.
Plunger gates are connected to bias-tees where the DC line goes to the QDAC2 or another DC voltage source and the AC 
lines go to the OPX analog outputs.

The qubit is driven via exchange interactions and the detuning pulses are generated by the OPX.

Readout can be performed using either RF-reflectometry if a tank circuit is wired to the sensor gate or DC current 
sensing (transport measurement) via a trans-impedance amplifier (IV converter).

These files were tested in a real setup, but are given as-is with no guarantee.

While these can serve as a template for new labs or for new experiments, certain adaptations will probably have to be 
made. Use with care.

## Use Cases

These folders contain various examples of protocols made with the OPX, including the results. The scripts are tailored to
a specific setup and would require changes to run on different setups.
