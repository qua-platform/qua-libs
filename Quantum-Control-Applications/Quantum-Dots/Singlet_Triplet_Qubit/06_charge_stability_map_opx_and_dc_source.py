        CHARGE STABILITY MAP - fast axis: OPX (AC) & slow axis: external source (DC)
The goal of the script is to acquire the charge stability map.
Here the charge stability diagram is acquired by sweeping the fast axis with the OPX connected to the AC part of the
bias-tee, while the slow axis is handled by an external source connected to the DC part of the bias-tee.

This is done by pausing the QUA program, updating the voltages in Python using the instrument API and resuming the QUA program.
The OPX is simply measuring, either via dc current sensing or RF reflectometry, the charge occupation of the dot.

A single-point averaging is performed and the data is extracted while the program is running to display the results line-by-line.

Prerequisites:
    - Readout calibration (resonance frequency for RF reflectometry and sensor operating point for DC current sensing).
    - Setting the parameters of the external DC source using its driver.
    - Connect one plunger gate (DC line of the bias-tee) to the external dc source and the other plunger gate (AC line of the bias-tee) to tne OPX.

Before proceeding to the next node:
    - Identify the different charge occupation regions
