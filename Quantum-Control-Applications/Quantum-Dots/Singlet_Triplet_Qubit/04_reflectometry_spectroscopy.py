"""
        RF REFLECTOMETRY SPECTROSCOPY
The goal of this script is to perform the spectroscopy of the RF-reflectometry readout.
For this, the frequency of the element (pulser) used for reflectometry readout is being swept and the signal reflected
by the tank circuit is being acquired, demodulated and integrated by the OPX.

A global averaging is performed (averaging on the most outer loop) and the data is extracted while the program is running
to display the frequency response of the tank circuit with increasing SNR.

Prerequisites:
    - Connect the tank circuit to the corresponding output and input channels.

Before proceeding to the next node:
    - Update the config with the resonance frequency for reflectometry readout.
