"""
        CHARGE SENSOR GATE SWEEP with the OPX
Here the voltage biasing the sensor gate is provided and being swept by the OPX connected to the DC line of the bias-tee.
A sticky element is used in order to maintain the voltage level and avoid fast voltage drops. Note that the OPX signal
can be combined with an external dc source to increase the dynamics.
The OPX is also measuring, either via dc current sensing or RF reflectometry, the response of the sensor dot.

A global average is performed (averaging on the most outer loop) and the data is extracted while the program is running
to display the full charge stability map with increasing SNR.
The script can also be easily modified to perform single point averaging instead.

Prerequisites:
    - Connect one the DC line of the bias-tee connected to the sensor dot to one OPX channel.
    - Setting the parameters of the external DC source using its driver if needed.

Before proceeding to the next node:
    - Update the config with the optimal sensing point.
