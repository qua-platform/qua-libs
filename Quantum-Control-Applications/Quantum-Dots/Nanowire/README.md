# Quantum dot device with an ESR line and RF-reflectometry or DC current sensing.

## Experimental setup and context

<img align="right" src="schematic.PNG" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

These files showcase various experiments that can be done on a quantum dot device based on SiGe nanowire.
Plunger gates are connected to bias-tees where the DC line goes to the QDAC2 or another DC voltage source and the AC line goes to the OPX analog outputs.

The qubit is driven via EDSR and the pulses are generated by the OPX and are up-converted to the GHz range either by the Octave or an IQ mixer with an external LO source.

Readout can be performed using either RF-reflectometry if a tank circuit is wired to the sensor gate or DC current sensing via a trans-impedance amplifier (IV converter).

These files were tested in a real setup shown on the right, but are given as-is with no guarantee.

While these can serve as a template for new labs or for new experiments, certain adaptations will probably have to be made.
Use with care.

## Basic Files

## Use Cases

These folders contain various examples of protocols made with the OPX, including the results. The scripts are tailored to
a specific setup and would require changes to run on different setups. Current use-cases:
