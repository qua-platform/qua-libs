# Quantum Control Applications

This folder contains scripts and examples for different qubits types, all the way from basic to advanced protocols. 
It also includes various examples and results from labs as listed below.

Note that for them to work, you would need to download the latest version of the [py-qua-tools](https://github.com/qua-platform/py-qua-tools#installation).
