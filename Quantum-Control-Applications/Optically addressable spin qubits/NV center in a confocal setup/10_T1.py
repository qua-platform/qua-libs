"""
       T1 MEASUREMENT
The program consists in measuring the photon counts (in |0> and |1> successively) received by the SPCM across 
varying wait times either after initialization (start from |0>), or after a pi pulse (start from |1>).
The sequence is repeated without playing the mw pulses to measure the dark counts on the SPCM.

The data is then post-processed to determine the thermal relaxation time T1.

Prerequisites:
    - Ensure calibration of the different delays in the system (calibrate_delays).
    - Having updated the different delays in the configuration.
    - Having updated the NV frequency, labeled as "NV_IF_freq", in the configuration.
    - Having set the pi pulse amplitude and duration in the configuration

Next steps before going to the next node:
