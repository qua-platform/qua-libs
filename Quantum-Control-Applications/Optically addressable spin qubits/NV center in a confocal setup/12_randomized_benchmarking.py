"""
        SINGLE QUBIT RANDOMIZED BENCHMARKING (for gates >= 40ns)
The program consists in playing random sequences of Clifford gates and measuring the state of the resonator afterwards.
Each random sequence is derived on the FPGA for the maximum depth (specified as an input) and played for each depth
asked by the user (the sequence is truncated to the desired depth). Each truncated sequence ends with the recovery gate,
found at each step thanks to a preloaded lookup table (Cayley table), that will bring the qubit back to its ground state.

Each sequence is played n_avg times for averaging. A second averaging is performed by playing different random sequences.

The data is then post-processed to extract the single-qubit gate fidelity and error per gate
.
Prerequisites:
    - Ensure calibration of the different delays in the system (calibrate_delays).
    - Having updated the different delays in the configuration.
    - Having updated the NV frequency, labeled as "NV_IF_freq", in the configuration.
    - Having set the pi pulse amplitude and duration in the configuration
