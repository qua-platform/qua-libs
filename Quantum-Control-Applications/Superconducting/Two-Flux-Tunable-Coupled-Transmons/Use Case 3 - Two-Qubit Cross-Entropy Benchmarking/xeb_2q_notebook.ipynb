    "# Cross Entropy Benchmarking \n",
    "\n",
    "Cross entropy benchmarking (XEB) is a method for characterizing the fidelity of a two-qubit gate.\n",
    "The XEB sequence consists in a series of cycles composed of randomly selected single-qubit gates and a two-qubit gate,\n",
    "followed by a measurement.\n",
    "The sequence is repeated many times, and the results are used to calculate the cross entropy between the ideal and measured states.\n",
    "The cross entropy is a measure of the distance between two probability distributions, and is related to the fidelity of the two-qubit gate.\n",
    "The cross entropy is calculated as follows:\n",
    "    1. The ideal state is calculated by applying the sequence of single-qubit gates and the two-qubit gate to the initial state |00>. We use Qiskit to reconstruct the ideal state and for showing the `QuantumCircuit`s that are used.\n",
    "    2. The measured state is calculated by applying the sequence of single-qubit gates to the initial state |00>, followed by a measurement.\n",
    "    3. The cross entropy is calculated between the ideal and measured states.\n",
    "The cross entropy is calculated for a range of sequence depths, and the results are used to compute the fidelity of the two-qubit gate.\n",
    "In this script, we provide an example of how to run an XEB sequence on the OPX. For the post-processing, we use Qiskit\n",
    "to reconstruct the ideal state from the randomly generated sequence and to calculate the cross entropy. We then use tools derived from Cirq Experiments library (https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/main/cirq-core/cirq/experiments/xeb_fitting.py) to calculate the XEB fidelity of the two-qubit gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: To run the script, it is necessary to install Qiskit. The reader can refer to the installation guide for Qiskit 1.0 at https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html or the more recent video: https://youtu.be/dZWz4Gs_BuI?si=EOqyeOhZ05YcBlXA .\n",

    "- `assign_amplitude_matrix`: Assigns the amplitude matrix arguments for a given gate index. This assignment is done in real time through the use of a QUA switch-case statement.\n",
    "- `qua_declaration`: Declares the necessary QUA variables for storing the readout results (in-phase and quadrature components).\n",
    "- `cz_gate`: Performs the CZ gate between two qubits. The CZ gate is performed by playing the CZ operation on the element associated with the CZ gate.\n",
    "- `play_T_gate_set`: Defines the play command for the T gate set. The T gate set consists of the $SX$, $SY$, and $T$ gates. $SY$ is played from the baseline $SX$ gate, modulated with a specific amplitude matrix. For the $T$ gate, a frame rotation is applied.\n",
    "- `play_SW_gate_set`: Defines the play command for the SW gate set. The SW gate set consists of the $SX$, $SY$, and $SW$ gates. $SY$ is played as its own calibrated gate (could actually be done in a similar way to the method associated to $T$ gate set, we show both cases for completeness)/ For the $SW$ gate, the $SX$ gate is played with a specific amplitude matrix enabling a rotation around the $X+Y$ axis.\n",

    "- `align_qubit`: Aligns the elements characterizing one qubit (e.g., the qubit drive element, its flux pulse element, and its readout resonator element).\n",
    "- `readout`: Performs the qubit readout. The readout is performed by playing the readout pulse on the readout resonator element and demodulating the signal. The in-phase and quadrature components are saved in the corresponding streams. The amplitude of the readout signal can be set to a specific value by the user, as well as the integration weights used for demodulation. The readout pulse name (named `\"readout\"` here) can also be adapted to match the user's configuration.\n",
    "- `active_reset`: Performs the active reset of the qubit. The active reset is performed by applying a $X$ gate on the qubit if the resonator has not exited the reset state. The qubit is then read out, and the state of the qubit is estimated. If the qubit is not in the ground state, the qubit is reset again. The user can set the time for the resonator to deplete, the threshold for the resonator to exit the reset, the threshold for the qubit to be in the ground state, and the state of the qubit. The name of the pi pulse (named `\"x\"` here) can be adapted to match the user's configuration. "

    "   - The variable `amp_matrix` is a list of lists of QUA arrays of size `depths[-1]`. The outer dimension corresponds to the qubit index, and the inner dimension corresponds to the amplitude matrix of the gate at a given depth. To facilitate the looping over the depth using a QUA for loop, the depth is set in the most inner dimension.\n",

    "For each random sequence and for each depth of the selected `depths` array, the program does the following:\n",

Note that we save all the sampled indices in the stream-processing in order to reconstruct in the post-processing the circuit that was run and deduce from it the ideal (noise-free) quantum state.\n",
