"""
        SINGLE QUBIT STATE TOMOGRAPHY
The sequence consists of preparing the qubit into a chosen state using calibrated gates from the config, and
measuring the state of the qubit, by way of the readout resonator, in the X, Y and Z bases. The output,
'probs', is a triple of probability 'difference' counts for measuring the qubit in one eigenstate of the
X/Y/Z bases, minus the probability of measuring it in that eigenstate's complement.

These values are scaled into the usual Stokes parameters and used to infer the state of the qubit; see
https://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/tomography-files/tomo_chapter_2004.pdf for further details

Note that this program is similar to 
qua-libs/Quantum-Control-Applications/Superconducting/Single-Fixed-Transmon
/19_state_tomography.py, which the author became aware of after having
written the current script

Prerequisites:
    - Having found the resonance frequency of the resonator coupled to the qubit under study (resonator_spectroscopy)
    - Having calibrated qubit pi and pi/2 pulses by running qubit spectroscopy, rabi_chevron, power_rabi and updating the config
    - Having calibrated the readout (readout_frequency, amplitude, duration_optimization IQ_blobs) for better SNR, and having
      saved the derived readout threshold value in the config
    - Set the desired flux bias in the case of flux-tunable qubits

This script implements the logic outlined in the notebook
https://github.com/bornman-nick/quantum-state-and-process-tomography. See that
notebook for a detailed explanation of standard single qubit state
tomography.
