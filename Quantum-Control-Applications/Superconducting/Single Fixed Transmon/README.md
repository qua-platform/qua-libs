# Single Fixed Transmon Superconducting Qubit

## Basic Files
These files showcase various experiments that can be done on a Single Fixed Transmon Superconducting Qubit.
These files were tested on real qubits, but are given as-is with no guarantee.
While these can serve as a template for new labs or for new experiments, certain adaptations will probably have to be made.
Use with care.

## Use Cases

These folders contain various examples of protocols made with the OPX, including the results. The scripts are tailored to
a specific setup and would require changes to run on different setups. Current use-cases:

* <a href="./Use Case 1 - Schuster Lab - Qubit Frequency Tracking/README.md">Schuster Lab - Qubit Frequency Tracking</a> - 
The goal of this measurement is to track the frequency fluctuations of the transmon qubit, and update the frequency of the qubit element accordingly using a closed-loop feedback.
