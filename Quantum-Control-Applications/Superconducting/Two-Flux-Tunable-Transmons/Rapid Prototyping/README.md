# Two flux tunable transmons with the rapid prototyping

<img align="right" src="Two Flux Tunable Transmon Setup.PNG" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

## Experimental setup and context

These files showcase various experiments that can be done on Two flux tunable transmons with individual qubit drive lines 
and a single readout transmission line.
The readout pulses are sent through an IQ mixer and down-converted through an IQ mixer. 
Qubit addressing is being done with IQ mixers.

These files were tested in a real setup shown on the right, but are given as-is with no guarantee.

While these can serve as a template for new labs or for new experiments, certain adaptations will probably have to be made.
Use with care.

## QuAM and Rapid Prototyping
The goal of the rapid prototyping is to give users the possibility to define their own structure (JSON file) to store 
the different parameters describing the state of the quantum system (LO and IF frequencies, wiring, flux points, 
pulse amplitudes and durations...).
Additionally, the QuAM SDK creates a python class out of the user-defined JSON structure that can then be used in the 
calibration scripts to set and get the qubit parameters.

The configuration dictionary that the OPX expects is then built using a one-to-one mapping between the config fields and 
the values from the user-defined structure as shown below.

A step-by-step [tutorial](https://github.com/qua-platform/qua-libs/tree/main/Tutorials/intro-to-quam-rapid-prototyping/README.md) details the basics of this framework and shows how to create your own QuAM (Quantum Abstract Machine).
