# Two flux tunable transmons with the standard configuration

<img align="right" src="Two Flux Tunable Transmon Setup.PNG" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

## Experimental setup and context

These files showcase various experiments that can be done on Two flux tunable transmons with individual qubit drive lines 
and a single readout transmission line.
The readout pulses are sent through an IQ mixer and down-converted through an IQ mixer. 
Qubit addressing is being done with IQ mixers.

These files were tested in a real setup shown on the right, but are given as-is with no guarantee.

While these can serve as a template for new labs or for new experiments, certain adaptations will probably have to be made.
Use with care.

## Use Cases

These folders contain various examples of protocols made with the OPX, including the results. The scripts are tailored to
a specific setup and would require changes to run on different setups. Current use-cases:

* [Two qubit gate optimization with cryoscope](../Use%20Case%201%20-%20Two%20qubit%20gate%20optimization%20with%20cryoscope)
The goal of this use-case is to perform SWAP spectroscopy and improve the SWAP fidelity by correcting for the flux pulse 
distortion using Cryoscope and the OPX IIR and FIR filters..

## Set-ups with Octave

The configuration included in this folder correspond to a set-up without Octave. 
However, a few files are there to facilitate the integration of the Octave:
1. [configuration_with_octave.py](configuration_with_octave.py): An example of a configuration including the octave. You can replace the content of the file called `configuration.py` by this one so that it will be imported in all the scripts above.
2. [octave_configuration.py](octave_configuration.py): A file __to execute__ in order to configure and/or calibrate the Octave.
3. [set_octave.py](set_octave.py): A set of helper function to ease the octave parametrization.

If you are a new Octave user, then it is recommended to start with the [Octave tutorial](https://github.com/qua-platform/qua-libs/blob/main/Tutorials/intro-to-octave/README.md).
