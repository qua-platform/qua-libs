## Experimental setup and context

These files showcase various experiments that can be done on an single flux tunable transmon.
The readout pulses are sent through a SSB mixer but are downconverted through an IQ mixer. 
Qubit addressing is being done with and IQ mixer.

These files were tested in a real setup shown on the right, but are given as-is with no guarantee.

While these can serve as a template for new labs or for new experiments, certain adaptations will probably have to be made.
Use with care.

## Basic Files
1. [Hello_qua](hello_qua.py) - A script used for basic qua program demonstration.
2. [raw_adc_traces](raw_adc_traces.py) - A script for acquiring raw ADC traces from inputs 1 and 2 and check ADC saturation and time of flight.
3. [Resonator_spec](resonator_spec.py) - Performs the 1D and 2D (with flux amplitude sweep) resonator spectroscopy.
4. [Rabi_amp_freq](rabi_amp_freq.py) - Acquires the 2D (pulse amplitude & frequency sweeps) Rabi oscillations.
5. [ramsey_freq_duration](ramsey_freq_duration.py) - Acquires the 2D (idle time & pulse frequency sweeps) Ramsey oscillations.
6. [Resonator_spec_g_e](resonator_spec_g_e.py) -  Performs the 1D resonator spectroscopy for a ground and excited qubit (with IO values).
7. [IQ_blobs](IQ_blobs.py) - Performs a single shot discrimination and active reset.
8. [Tomography](tomography.py) - Performs the qubit tomography by scanning the phase of the 2nd pi/2 pulse.
9. [Cryoscope_amplitude_calibration](cryoscope_amplitude_calibration.py) - Performs the detuning vs flux pulse amplitude calibration prior to the cryoscope measurement. This gives the relation between the qubit detuning and flux pulse amplitude which should be quadratic.
10. [Cryoscope](cryoscope.py) - Performs the cryoscope measurement.
