# Single flux tunable transmon with SSB mixer for readout

<img align="right" src="Single Flux Tunable Transmon Setup.PNG" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

## Experimental setup and context

These files showcase various experiments that can be done on an single flux tunable transmon.
The readout pulses are sent through a SSB mixer but are downconverted through an IQ mixer. 
Qubit addressing is being done with and IQ mixer.

These files were tested in a real setup shown on the right, but are given as-is with no guarantee.

While these can serve as a template for new labs or for new experiments, certain adaptations will probably have to be made.
Use with care.

## Basic Files
1. [Hello_qua](hello_qua.py) - A script used for basic qua program demonstration.
2. [raw_adc_traces](raw_adc_traces.py) - A script for acquiring raw ADC traces from inputs 1 and 2 and check ADC saturation and time of flight.
3. [Resonator_spec](resonator_spec.py) - Performs the 1D and 2D (with flux amplitude sweep) resonator spectroscopy.
4. [Rabi_amp_freq](rabi_amp_freq.py) - Acquires the 2D (pulse amplitude & frequency sweeps) Rabi oscillations.
5. [ramsey_freq_duration](ramsey_freq_duration.py) - Acquires the 2D (idle time & pulse frequency sweeps) Ramsey oscillations.
6. [Resonator_spec_g_e](resonator_spec_g_e.py) -  Performs the 1D resonator spectroscopy for a ground and excited qubit (with IO values).
7. [IQ_blobs](IQ_blobs.py) - Performs a discrimination of the IQ blobs and derives the readout fidelity.
8. [Active_reset](active_reset.py) - Template to showcase the usage of active reset.
9. [Tomography](tomography.py) - Performs the qubit tomography by scanning the phase of the 2nd pi/2 pulse.
10. [Cryoscope_amplitude_calibration](cryoscope_amplitude_calibration.py) - Performs the detuning vs flux pulse amplitude calibration prior to the cryoscope measurement. This gives the relation between the qubit detuning and flux pulse amplitude which should be quadratic.
11. [Cryoscope](cryoscope.py) - Performs the cryoscope measurement.
12. [Calibration](calibrations.py) - Uses an API to perform several single qubit calibrations easily from a single file. 
13. **DRAG calibration** -  Calibrates the DRAG coefficient `$\alpha$` and AC-Stark shift:
    * [Google method](DRAG_calibration_Google.py) - Performs `x180` and `-x180` pulses to obtain 
the DRAG coefficient `$\alpha$`
    * [Yale method](DRAG_calibration_Yale.py) - Performs `x180y90` and `y180x90` pulses to obtain 
the DRAG coefficient `$\alpha$`
    * [2D](AC_Stark_2Dcalibration_Google.py) - Calibrates the AC Stark shift using a sequence of `x180` and `-x180` pulses by plotting the 2D map DRAG pulse detuning versus number of iterations.
    * [1D](AC_Stark_1Dcalibration_Google.py) - Calibrates the AC Stark shift using a sequence of `x180` and `-x180` pulses by scanning the DRAG pulse detuning for a given number of pulses.
14. [Optimal Readout Weights](optimal_weights.py) - Performs sliced.demodulation to obtain the trajectories of the |e> and |g> states, and from them it calculates the normalized optimal readout weights.
15. **Readout optimization** - The optimal separation between the |g> and |e> blobs lies in a phase spaced of amplitude, duration, and frequency of the readout pulse:
    * [Frequency optimization](readout_frequency_optimization.py) - The script performs frequency scaning and from the results calculates the SNR between |g> and |e> blobs. As a result you can find the optimal frequency for discrimination.
    * [Duration optimization](readout_duration_opt.py) - The scrips performs accumulated demodulation for a given frequency, amplitude, and total duration of readout pulse, and plots the SNR as as a function of readout time.

## Use Cases

These folders contain various examples of protocols made with the OPX, including the results. The scripts are tailored to
a specific setup and would require changes to run on different setups. Current use-cases:

* [Paraoanu Lab - Cryoscope](./Use%20Case%201%20-%20Paraoanu%20Lab%20-%20Cryoscope)
The goal of this use-case is to implement Cryoscope.
* [DRAG coefficient calibration](./Use%20Case%202%20-%20DRAG%20coefficient%20calibration) 
The goal of this experiment is to calibrate the DRAG coefficient and AC Start shift
to increase the single qubit gate fidelity as well as to minimize the leakage out of the
computational space.
