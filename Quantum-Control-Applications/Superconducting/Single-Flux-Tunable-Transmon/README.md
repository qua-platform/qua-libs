## Experimental setup and context

These files showcase various experiments that can be done on a single flux tunable transmon.
The readout pulses are sent through an IQ mixer and down-converted through an IQ mixer. 
Qubit addressing is being done with and IQ mixer.

These files were tested in a real setup shown on the right, but are given as-is with no guarantee.

While these can serve as a template for new labs or for new experiments, certain adaptations will probably have to be made.
Use with care.

## Use Cases

These folders contain various examples of protocols made with the OPX, including the results. The scripts are tailored to
a specific setup and would require changes to run on different setups. Current use-cases:

* [Ma Lab - Parametric Drive between flux-tunable-qubit and qubit-coupler](https://github.com/qua-platform/qua-libs/tree/main/Quantum-Control-Applications/Superconducting/Single-Flux-Tunable-Transmon/Use%20Case%203%20-%20Ma%20Lab%20-%20Parametric%20Drive%20iSWAP#parametric-drive-between-flux-tunable-qubit-and-qubit-coupler) 
  In this use-case, the parametric drive is demonstrated through the red- and blue-sideband transitions between a superconducting resonator and a flux-tunable transmon.
* [Paraoanu Lab - Cryoscope](./Use%20Case%201%20-%20Paraoanu%20Lab%20-%20Cryoscope)
The goal of this use-case is to implement Cryoscope.
* [DRAG coefficient calibration](./Use%20Case%202%20-%20DRAG%20coefficient%20calibration) 
The goal of this experiment is to calibrate the DRAG coefficient and AC Start shift
to increase the single qubit gate fidelity as well as to minimize the leakage out of the
computational space.

## Set-ups with Octave

The configuration included in this folder correspond to a set-up without Octave. 
However, a few files are there to facilitate the integration of the Octave:
1. [configuration_with_octave.py](./Single-Flux-Tunable-Transmon/configuration_with_octave.py): An example of a configuration including the octave. You can replace the content of the file called `configuration.py` by this one so that it will be imported in all the scripts above.
2. [octave_configuration.py](./Single-Flux-Tunable-Transmon/octave_configuration.py): A file __to execute__ in order to configure and/or calibrate the Octave.
3. [set_octave.py](./Single-Flux-Tunable-Transmon/set_octave.py): A set of helper function to ease the octave parametrization.

If you are a new Octave user, then it is recommended to start with the [Octave tutorial](https://github.com/qua-platform/qua-libs/blob/main/Tutorials/intro-to-octave/README.md).
