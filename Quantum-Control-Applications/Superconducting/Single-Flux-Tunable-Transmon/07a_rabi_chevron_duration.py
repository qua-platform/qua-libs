"""
        RABI CHEVRON (DURATION VS FREQUENCY)
This sequence involves executing the qubit pulse (such as x180, square_pi, or other types) and measuring the state
of the resonator across various qubit intermediate frequencies and pulse durations.
Analyzing the results allows for determining the qubit and estimating the x180 pulse duration for a specific amplitude.

Prerequisites:
    - Determination of the resonator's resonance frequency when coupled to the qubit of interest (referred to as "resonator_spectroscopy").
    - Calibration of the IQ mixer connected to the qubit drive line (be it an external mixer or an Octave port).
    - Identification of the approximate qubit frequency (referred to as "qubit_spectroscopy").
    - Configuration of the qubit frequency and the desired pi pulse amplitude (labeled as "x180_amp").
    - Set the desired flux bias

Before proceeding to the next node:
    - Adjust the qubit frequency setting, labeled as "qubit_IF", in the configuration.
    - Modify the qubit pulse duration setting, labeled as "x180_len", in the configuration.
