"""
        ACTIVE RESET
This script is used to benchmark different types of qubit initialization including active reset protocols.
the different methods are written in macros for better readability.

Each protocol is detailed in the corresponding docstring, but the idea behind active reset is to first measure one
quadrature of the resonator ("I") and compare it to one or two threshold in order to decide whether to apply a pi-pulse
(qubit in |e>), do nothing (qubit in |g>) or measure again if the qubit state is undetermined (active_reset_two_thresholds).

Then, after qubit initialization, the IQ blobs for |g> and |e> are measured again and the readout fidelity is derived
similarly to what is done in IQ_blobs.py.

Prerequisites:
    - Having found the resonance frequency of the resonator coupled to the qubit under study (resonator_spectroscopy).
    - Having calibrated qubit pi pulse (x180) by running qubit, spectroscopy, rabi_chevron, power_rabi and updated the config.
    - Having calibrated the IQ blobs (rotation_angle and ge_threshold).
    - (optional) Having calibrated the readout (readout_frequency_, _amplitude_, _duration_optimization).
    - Having updated the rotation angle (rotation_angle) and g -> e threshold (ge_threshold) in the configuration (IQ_blobs.py).
