        CRYOSCOPE with 4ns granularity
The goal of this protocol is to measure the step response of the flux line and design proper FIR and IIR filters
(implemented on the OPX) to pre-distort the flux pulses and improve the two-qubit gates fidelity.
Since the flux line ends on the qubit chip, it is not possible to measure the flux pulse after propagation through the
fridge. The idea is to exploit the flux dependency of the qubit frequency, measured with a modified Ramsey sequence, to
estimate the flux amplitude received by the qubit as a function of time.

The sequence consists of a Ramsey sequence ("x90" - idle time - "x90" or "y90") with a fixed dephasing time.
A flux pulse with varying duration is played during the idle time. The Sx and Sy components of the Bloch vector are
measured by alternatively closing the Ramsey sequence with a "x90" or "y90" gate in order to extract the qubit dephasing
 as a function of the flux pulse duration.

The results are then post-processed to retrieve the step function of the flux line which is fitted with an exponential
function. The corresponding exponential parameters are then used to derive the FIR and IIR filter taps that will
compensate for the distortions introduced by the flux line (wiring, bias-tee...).
Such digital filters are then implemented on the OPX. Note that these filters will introduce a global delay on all the
output channels that may rotate the IQ blobs so that you may need to recalibrate them for state discrimination or
active reset protocols for instance. You can read more about these filters here:
https://docs.quantum-machines.co/0.1/qm-qua-sdk/docs/Guides/output_filter/?h=filter#hardware-implementation

The protocol is inspired from https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5133894, which contains more details about the sequence and
the post-processing of the data.

This version sweeps the flux pulse duration using real-time QUA, which means that the flux pulse can be arbitrarily long
but the step must be larger than 1 clock cycle (4ns) and the minimum pulse duration must be 4 clock cycles (16ns).

Prerequisites:
    - Having found the resonance frequency of the resonator coupled to the qubit under study (resonator_spectroscopy).
    - Having calibrated qubit gates (x90 and y90) by running qubit spectroscopy, rabi_chevron, power_rabi, Ramsey and updated the configuration.
    - (optional) Having calibrated the readout to perform state discrimination (IQ_blobs).

Next steps before going to the next node:
    - Update the FIR and IIR filter taps in the configuration (config/controllers/con1/analog_outputs/"filter": {"feedforward": fir, "feedback": iir}).
    - WARNING: the digital filters will add a global delay --> need to recalibrate IQ blobs (rotation_angle & ge_threshold).
