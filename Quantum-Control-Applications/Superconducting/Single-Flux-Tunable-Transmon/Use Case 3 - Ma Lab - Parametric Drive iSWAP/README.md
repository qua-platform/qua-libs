to run the experiment, so it is tailored for the specific software environment
and set up. Thus, this is code is for inspirational purposes._

## 1. The goal

In this use-case, the parametric drive is demonstrated through the red- and blue-sideband transitions between a superconducting resonator and a flux-tunable transmon. The resonator acts as a coupler between two qubits. The use-case highlights the capability to facilitate iSWAP transitions between photons in the qubit and those in the resonator (coupler). The particle exchange is driven by the flux line to the qubit using RF tones. Notably, the red-sideband operates in the MHz frequency range, while the blue-sideband functions in the GHz range. Below, you'll find a schematic of the energy diagram, accompanied by an illustration depicting the two qubits and the coupler. Note that the flux-tunable transmon has separate readout resonator.
