"""
        RESONATOR DEPLETION TIME
This sequence is designed to measure the resonator depletion time.
It begins by sending a MW pulse to the resonator to fill it with photons via measure().
Subsequently, a Ramsey measurement is performed after allowing a variable waiting time (structured as:
wait(t) - x90 - idle_time - x90 - measurement). Given that the qubit frequency is influenced by the number of photons
in the resonator, an exponential decay should be evident in the measured I/Q quadratures.
This provides insight into the resonator depletion time, which can then be updated in the configuration.

Prerequisites:
    - Having found the resonance frequency of the resonator coupled to the qubit under study (resonator_spectroscopy).
    - Having calibrated qubit pi pulse (x180) by running qubit, spectroscopy, rabi_chevron, power_rabi and updated the config.
    - Having precisely measured the qubit frequency (ramsey).
    - Set the desired flux bias

Next steps before going to the next node:
    - Update the resonator depletion time (depletion_time) in the configuration.
