# Macro for measuring the qubit state with single shot

    A macro for performing the single-shot readout, with the ability to perform state discrimination.
    If `threshold` is given, the information in the `I` quadrature will be compared against the threshold and `state`
    would be `True` if `I > threshold`.
    Note that it is assumed that the results are rotated such that all the information is in the `I` quadrature.

    :param threshold: Optional. The threshold to compare `I` against.
    :param state: A QUA variable for the state information, only used when a threshold is given.
        Should be of type `bool`. If not given, a new variable will be created
    :param I: A QUA variable for the information in the `I` quadrature. Should be of type `Fixed`. If not given, a new
        variable will be created
    :param Q: A QUA variable for the information in the `Q` quadrature. Should be of type `Fixed`. If not given, a new
        variable will be created
