## Basic Files
These files showcase various experiments that can be done on a Single Fixed Transmon Superconducting Qubit.
These files were tested on real qubits, but are given as-is with no guarantee.

While these can serve as a template for new labs or for new experiments, certain adaptations will probably have to be made.

## Use Cases
These folders contain various examples of protocols made with the OPX, including the results. The scripts are tailored to
a specific setup and would require changes to run on different setups. Current use-cases:

* [Schuster Lab - Qubit Frequency Tracking](./Use%20Case%201%20-%20Schuster%20Lab%20-%20Qubit%20Frequency%20Tracking)
The goal of this measurement is to track the frequency fluctuations of the transmon qubit, and update the frequency of the qubit element accordingly using a closed-loop feedback.
* [Optimized Readout with Optimal Weights](./Use%20Case%202%20-%20Optimized%20readout%20with%20optimal%20weights) 
The goal of this experiment is to optimize the information obtained from the readout of a superconducting resonator by deriving the optimal integration weights. With the usage of optimal integration weights we maximize the separation of the IQ blobs when the ground and excited state are measured.


## Set-ups with Octave

The configuration included in this folder correspond to a set-up without an Octave. 
However, a few files are there to facilitate the integration of the Octave:
1. [configuration_with_octave.py](./Single-Fixed-Transmon/configuration_with_octave.py): An example of a configuration including the octave. You can replace the content of the file called `configuration.py` by this one so that it will be imported in all the scripts above.
2. [octave_clock_and_calibration.py](./Single-Fixed-Transmon/octave_clock_and_calibration.py): A file __to execute__ in order to configure the Octave's clock and calibrate the Octave.
3. [set_octave.py](./Single-Fixed-Transmon/set_octave.py): A helper function to ease the octave initialization.

If you are a new Octave user, then it is recommended to start with the [Octave tutorial](https://github.com/qua-platform/qua-libs/blob/main/Tutorials/intro-to-octave/README.md).
