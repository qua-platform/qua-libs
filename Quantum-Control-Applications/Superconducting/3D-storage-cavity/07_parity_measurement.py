        PARITY MEASUREMENT
This sequence involves two consecutive measurements:
The first one measures the background, by applying a displacement pulse, then apply x90 - wait time - -x90 and measure the resonator, while sweeping over the idle time.
The second one starts by applying a displacement pulse, then apply x90 - wait time - -x90 and then measure by applying a selective pi-pulse (x180_long)
with the frequency that corresponds to Fock state n=1 (this can be changed by changing the IF, while sweeping over the idle time).
Then we subtract the two measurements in order to get the behaviour of Fock state n=1 (or a different n) in order to find t parity
(which is the time we need to wait between the two pi/2 pulses in order to distinguish between even and odd parity).


Prerequisites:
    - Identification of the resonator's resonance frequency when coupled to the qubit in question (referred to as "resonator_spectroscopy").
    - Calibration of the IQ mixer connected to the resonator drive line (whether it's an external mixer or an Octave port).
    - Identification of the qubit's resonance frequency (referred to as "qubit_spectroscopy").
    - Calibration of the IQ mixer connected to the qubit drive line (whether it's an external mixer or an Octave port).
    - Having calibrated qubit pi pulse (x180_len) by running qubit, spectroscopy, rabi_chevron, power_rabi and updated the config.
    - Having calibrated qubit's frequency that corresponds to Fock state n=1 by running number_splitting_spectroscopy.
    - Specification of the expected storage_thermalization_time of the storage in the configuration.

Before proceeding to the next node:
    - Update the time we need to wait in parity measurements, labeled as t_parity.
