# Simulation Testing (Quantum Dots)

This directory contains simulation tests for the Loss-DiVincenzo quantum dot calibrations.

## Where to Start

See the Loss-DiVincenzo simulation README for the full workflow:

`tests/simulation/qualibration_graphs/quantum_dots/calibrations/loss_divincenzo/README.md`

## Quick Run

```bash
RUN_SIM_TESTS=1 pytest tests/simulation/qualibration_graphs/quantum_dots/calibrations/loss_divincenzo/ -v
```

## Artifacts

Generated artifacts live under:

```
tests/simulation/artifacts/<node_name>/
```
