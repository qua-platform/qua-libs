# TODO: Implement this protocol

"""
Validates the effectiveness of digital crosstalk cancellation.

Using the pre-compensation matrix derived from XY_crosstalk_coupling_strength
and XY_crosstalk_coupling_phase, pre-distorted drive signals are applied to
suppress off-diagonal couplings. The protocol then repeats Rabi measurements
on all qubits while targeting one qubit at a time. Successful cancellation is
indicated when the residual off-diagonal responses remain below the specified
leakage threshold (say, 1â€“2% of the on-target Rabi rate).
