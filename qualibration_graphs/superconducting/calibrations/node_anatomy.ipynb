    "# Anatomy of a QualibrationNode\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide dissects a typical QUAlibrate calibration node, using the `02a_resonator_spectroscopy.py` script as a concrete example. We will go through the script section by section, presenting the code first, followed by a detailed explanation of its purpose and functionality within the node's workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "All calibration node scripts follow a standardized structure, segmented into distinct sections using `# %% {Section Name}` separators. This consistent structure makes nodes easier to understand, maintain, and integrate. This segmentation also allows developers to run individual cells interactively within a Python kernel (e.g., in VS Code), which is highly beneficial for development and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common sections found in most calibration nodes are:\n",
    "* `Imports`: Handles all necessary library and module imports.\n",
    "* `Initialisation`: Defines the node, description, parameters, and loads the QUAM state.\n",
    "* `Create_QUA_program`: Defines the core QUA pulse sequence for the experiment.\n",
    "* `Simulate` (Optional): Simulates the QUA program's waveforms and timing.\n",
    "* `Execute`: Runs the QUA program on the quantum hardware and fetches results.\n",
    "* `Load_data` (Optional): Loads data from a previous run instead of executing.\n",
    "* `Analyse_data`: Processes the raw data and performs fitting or analysis.\n",
    "* `Plot_data`: Generates plots visualizing the data and analysis results.\n",
    "* `Update_state`: Proposes modifications to the QUAM state based on results.\n",
    "* `Save_results`: Persists all parameters, results, figures, and proposed state updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these common sections typically corresponds to a Python function decorated with `@node.run_action`. This decorator effectively encapsulates the logic for that specific step (like creating the QUA program or analysing data) and registers it as an action associated with the node instance, much like a method belongs to a class object. This approach promotes modularity and allows the QUAlibrate framework to manage the execution flow, including conditional skipping of steps."

    "- **Qualang Tools:** Imports specific utilities like `from_array` (for easily iterating over numpy arrays in QUA), `qm_session` (a context manager for handling Quantum Machine execution, preventing conflicts), `progress_counter` (for displaying progress during data acquisition), and `unit` (for handling physical units and conversions).\n",
    "- **QUAlibrate/QUAM Core:** Imports `QualibrationNode` (the core class for creating calibration nodes) and `logger` from `qualibrate`, and the `Quam` class itself from the `quam_config` package.\n",
    "- **Experiment-Specific Imports:** Imports the `Parameters` class specific to this resonator spectroscopy experiment, along with functions for processing (`process_raw_dataset`), fitting (`fit_raw_data`), logging (`log_fitted_results`), and plotting (`plot_raw_amplitude_with_fit`, `plot_raw_phase`) from the corresponding `qualibration_utils.resonator_spectroscopy` package.\n",
    "- **Workflow/Helper Imports:** The package `qualibration_libs` contains a series of tools that are generally useful for calibration nodes, as opposed to being useful for a specific node. This includes `get_qubits` (a helper to determine which qubits to target based on parameters), `simulate_and_plot` (a workflow utility for running simulations), and `XarrayDataFetcher` (a tool for fetching results from QUA jobs directly into xarray Datasets)."

    "\n",
    "This run action defines the core QUA pulse sequence for performing resonator spectroscopy. Its main goal is to generate a QUA program that sweeps the readout frequency around the expected resonance for each target qubit and measures the corresponding I/Q response, averaging the results for noise reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preparations:** The action first defines relevant variables for the QUA probram. \n",
    "  Relevant sweeps are collected into `node.namespace[\"sweep_axes\"]`, to be used within the QUA program, and also by the `XarrayDataFetcher` to automatically associate the correct coordinate axes to the fetched data.\n",
    "- **Program Definition** It then enters the `with program()` context to define the QUA sequence. Inside, it declares necessary QUA variables and streams, often using helper methods from the loaded `Quam` object (`node.machine`) for consistency.\n",
    "- **Nested Loops:** The core logic involves nested loops:\n",
    "    1.  An outer loop (`for multiplexed_qubits in qubits.batch()`) iterates through groups of qubits that can be measured in parallel.\n",
    "    2.  An averaging loop (`with for_(n,...)`) repeats the measurement `n_avg` times.\n",
    "    3.  A frequency sweep loop (`with for_(*from_array(df, dfs))`) iterates through the calculated frequency detuning values.\n",
    "    4.  An inner loop (`for i, qubit in multiplexed_qubits.items()`) handles operations for each qubit within the current parallel batch.\n",
    "- **Measurement Sequence:** Inside the innermost loop, for each qubit and frequency point:\n",
    "    1.  The resonator's frequency is updated (`rr.update_frequency(...)`).\n",
    "    2.  A measurement pulse is played, and the result demodulated (`rr.measure(\"readout\", ...)`).\n",
    "    3.  A wait time allows the resonator to relax (`rr.wait(...)`).\n",
    "    4.  The raw I/Q results are saved to streams (`save(I[i], ...)`).\n",
    "- **QUAM Integration:** The code heavily relies on the `Quam` object (`node.machine` and `qubit.resonator`) to get parameters like pulse names (\"readout\"), element properties (intermediate frequency, depletion time), and to use helper methods for QUA declaration, frequency updates, measurements, and waits.\n",
    "- **Stream Processing:** After the loops complete, a `with stream_processing()` block defines how the QOP should process the raw data streams. Here, it averages the I and Q values collected over all `n_avg` iterations for each frequency point and saves the resulting averaged vectors (one I vector and one Q vector per qubit).\n",
    "- **Output:** The generated QUA program is stored in `node.namespace[\"qua_program\"]`, and metadata about the sweep axes is stored in `node.namespace[\"sweep_axes\"]` for use in subsequent run actions (like execution and data fetching)."

    "This run action executes the QUA program on the actual hardware (QOP) and fetches the results.\n",
    "- **Decorator:** `@node.run_action(skip_if=node.parameters.load_data_id is not None or node.parameters.simulate)` ensures this action only runs if data isn't being loaded AND simulation is not enabled.\n",
    "- **Connection & Config:** Similar to the simulate action, it connects to the QMM (`node.machine.connect()`) and generates the hardware config (`node.machine.generate_config()`) using QUAM helpers.\n",
    "- **Execution Context:**\n",
    "    - `with qm_session(qmm, config, timeout=node.parameters.timeout) as qm:`: Uses the `qm_session` context manager (from `qualang_tools.multi_user`) to safely acquire and release the Quantum Machine (`qm`). This prevents multiple scripts from trying to use the same QOP simultaneously. A timeout parameter can be provided.\n",
    "- **Job Execution:**\n",
    "    - `node.namespace[\"job\"] = job = qm.execute(node.namespace[\"qua_program\"])`: Executes the QUA program stored in the namespace and stores the returned `job` object in the namespace as well.\n",
    "- **Data Fetching & Progress:**\n",
    "    - `data_fetcher = XarrayDataFetcher(job, node.namespace[\"sweep_axes\"])`: Initializes the `XarrayDataFetcher` tool, passing it the running `job` and the `sweep_axes` metadata defined earlier. This tool handles fetching data from the QOP streams and organizing it into an xarray Dataset with correctly labeled dimensions.\n",
    "    - `for dataset in data_fetcher:`: Iterates while the job is running. The `XarrayDataFetcher` yields intermediate or final datasets as data becomes available.\n",
    "    - For more details about the `XarrayDataFetcher`, see the documentation at [https://github.com/qua-platform/qualibration-libs](https://github.com/qua-platform/qualibration-libs)\n",
    "    - `progress_counter(...)`: Calls a utility to display a progress bar in the console based on the fetched value of the averaging counter (`data_fetcher[\"n\"]`) compared to the total number of averages (`node.parameters.num_averages`).\n",
    "- **Execution Report:** `print(job.execution_report())`: After the job finishes, prints a report containing information about the execution, including any potential runtime errors.\n",
    "- **Result Storage:** `node.results[\"ds_raw\"] = dataset`: Stores the final fetched dataset (containing the raw averaged I/Q values vs. frequency detuning for each qubit) in the `node.results` dictionary under the key \"ds_raw\"."
