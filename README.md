Hey! Glad to see you there!
 
Welcome to the QUA libraries repository. Your one-stop-shop for 
a batteries-included QUA experience. 

This repo is where we share particularly useful tools and protocols 
which can jump start many common tasks in and around QUA. 

This is an alpha version of the repo, containing a host of scripts, all placed in 
the [examples](/examples) folder. Each script has a readme.md file and should be self contained. 
However, we are very much in flux at the moment, if you see quirks and inaccuracies please tell us! 
Love to see some example that's not yet included? tell us! Have a request for a general purpose procedure? tell us! 
Already have something cool that others could use? Open a pull request! 
Issue reporting and requests should be done via the GitHub issues system, that should give a transparent experience where all users can see what's coming 
and which issues are already known. 

Another, maybe nicer, way to view the content on this repo is through [the libraries website](https://docs.qualang.io/). It includes those scripts that were placed in it via the
website config files (so possibly not everything currently on the repo). The site also has a blog where we will place technical posts that are of interest to the community. You can also suggest posts if you want. This is a nice way to showcase your work or ideas around QUA, and get full credit of course!

We hope this repo becomes a useful resource, giving real contribution to the community and we'd love to see your ideas and contributions too!
