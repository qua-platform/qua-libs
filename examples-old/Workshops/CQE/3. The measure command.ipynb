    "However, you can do much more than that. The measure command can combine measured samples in different ways, to provide a weighted sum (integration) of the samples, demodulate the signal, provide a vector of time stamps if the signal is composed of multiple rectangular pulses (time-tagging) and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "The measurement command always plays a pulse performing the measurement. The idea behind this is that you almost always need to drive the system you are measuring. You are going to be measuring reflection, fluorescence or something similar and so it stands to reason you also need to play a pulse to generate these effects.\n",

Unlike previous configurtion files in these notebooks, it also includes a section called `integration_weights`. Defining weights is mandatory when using integration or demodulation because, as stated above, the integration is a _weighted_ sum. "
