This website has a collection of scripts and tools to help you learn QUA and take shortcuts to 
get your experiments up and running. 

You can find simple scripts showing basic usage of variables but also more advanced features like waveform compression and 
advanced frequency modulation. It's not just feature usage though, with complete experimental 
case studies including for example an implementation of QRAM and advanced hybrid algorithms like QAOA, VQE and others. 

Usage is free and open. If you are interested in contributing to this collection (which we hope you are!), 
you can find details on the _contributing_ page.


## What to do first? 

If you've never used QUA before, we recommend you start by running the hello-qua example and then follow
the script in the _basic_ section. From there you can check out the _characterization_ and _calibration_ 
sections for some more advanced (but still quite basic) scripts.
