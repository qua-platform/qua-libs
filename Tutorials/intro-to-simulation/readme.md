This script intro-to-simulation.py shows usage of the hardware simulator. The simulator mimics the output of the
hardware,
with its exact timing and voltage level, following the compilation of QUA to the FPGA's low-level.
It is a useful tool for predicting and debugging the outcome of a QUA program.
Read more on the simulator, and it's capabilities in
the [QUA docs](https://docs.quantum-machines.co/latest/docs/Guides/simulator/).

In addition, the script cloud-simulator-example.py demonstrates the usage
of [QM cloud simulator](https://docs.quantum-machines.co/latest/docs/Guides/qm_saas_guide/), enabling to run the HW
simulator
on virtual instances (and doesn't require access to actual HW).

The intro-to-simulation Examples
============

The script gives three examples for the usage of the simulator in the QOP.

First and second examples
-------------

The first and second examples demonstrate basic usage of the simulator. Note that the simulation is done via the
QuantumMachinesManager (qmm) object.
The simulation function is given the configuration, the program and the `SimulationConfig` instance. The last sets the
duration for the
simulation. i.e. how many clock cycles should the simulator simulate. The outcome of the simulator is a `job` object.

The examples also demonstrate how to obtain and plot the simulated output of the hardware. Finally, the first example
also demonstrates
how the simulator can simulate saving variables to a stream, as would occur in the real hardware.

Third Example
==============

The third example demonstrates a slightly more advanced usage. It shows how a loop-back connection can be defined,
to simulate acquisition and demodulation of ADC signals. In the example, a connection from analog output 1 of controller
1
is connected to analog input 1 of controller 1. The example also shows that the demodulation and adc input can be
simulated
and saved to the stream processing, which later can be fetched and analyzed. It is important to note that the data will
only
be available if the simulation duration was long enough to simulate it. In the current example, to "fill" the buffer in
the stream processing,
the simulation must simulate the entire program with all the loop's iterations.

Fourth Example
=============

The fourth example demonstrates a simulation of a multi-controllers system. This is done by specifying the connectivity
between the different controllers.
This is important since The exact timing of multi-controllers operations is dependent on that connectivity
configuration.
In the example we use a tool to create the controllers' connections in the format that is required by the simulator.
The tool is available in our (very useful) repo [py-qua-tools](https://github.com/qua-platform/py-qua-tools).
