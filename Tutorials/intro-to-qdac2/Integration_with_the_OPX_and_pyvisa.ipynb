    "# Tutorial showing the integration between the QDAC2 and the OPX to perform voltage sweeps using the pyvisa commands\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn how to combine the QDAC2 with the OPX to perform n-dimensional voltage scans efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick here is to use a digital marker from the OPX to trigger the QDAC and make it step the output voltage of a given channel across a pre-loaded voltage list. Please note that the size of this list is limited to 65536 items per channel. To this purpose, an element called \"qdac_trigger1\" was created in the config and a digital pulse was defined. You can read more about digital waveform manipulations here: https://docs.quantum-machines.co/0.1/qm-qua-sdk/docs/Introduction/qua_overview/?h=digi#digital-waveform-manipulations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the latency induced by the communication between the control PC and the instruments and by transferring the data is suppressed since everything is controlled by the OPX pulse processor. The experimental runtime is then given by the QDAC bandwidth and the integration time. "
