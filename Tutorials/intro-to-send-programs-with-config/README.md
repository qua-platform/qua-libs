## Send programs with config (QOP350)

This tutorial explains the new **Send programs with config** feature introduced in **QOP350**.

### Overview
In previous QOP versions, once you opened a qm (=qmm.open_qm(config)) with a specific configuration dictionary, there is only limited modifications that can be done with quantum machines API [opx1000](https://docs.quantum-machines.co/latest/docs/API_references/qm_opx1000_api/) and [opx+](https://docs.quantum-machines.co/latest/docs/API_references/qm_api/). If you wanted to change the configuration in  parameters beyond the ones listed in the API, you had to close and reopen the `qm` with new configuration dictionary.

Starting with QOP350, you can:
- Modify temporarily the qm for specific program executions (i.e. `job=qm.execute()`) by providing a dedicated configuration dictionary that applies only to that execution, and the parameters can be further modified between from execution to execution.
- Update the `qm` with a new configuration dictionary without closing and re-opening.
- Avoid reopening qm after every changes of config.

### Backward Compatibility
This feature is fully backward compatible. You can still use the traditional workflow of opening a QM with a dedicated configuration for each program execution if you prefer.

### Configuration File Structure
We divide the full configuration into two parts: the controller configuration and logical configuration. The controller configuration specifies Digital Upconverters frequency, Digital Filters to compensate cable effects (e.g. skin effect) and Mixer Correction Matrix to correct for analog-mixer imperfections, etc. The logical configuration provides device-specific settings for the quantum device, such as, elements, pulses to define the elements' operations, waveforms to defines different pulses, etc.
 
Imagine an admin who has a quantum device and grants a user access. The admin opens the QM and updates calibration values as needed. The user can then submit jobs/experiments with only the logical configuration, without providing all the calibration details. This results in a simpler, more user-friendly workflow.

The new division is as follows,

1. **Controller Configuration**  
   Contains:
   - controllers
   - mixers

2. **Logical Configuration**  
   - elements
   - pulses
   - waveforms
   - digital_waveforms
   - integration_weights

### Examples
   In the folder, we provide two examples to show how to use this feature.

   1. Modify config On-the-Fly Without Reopening– Shows how to open a qm with a full configuration (demonstrating backward compatibility), run a job, then modify settings like DC offsets or pulse lengths before re-running. No need to reopen the QM — you can change parameters on-the-fly for faster experiment cycles.
   2. Time of flight calibration: Demonstrates running a raw ADC acquisition program and adjusting time of flight through config overrides between execution. Perfect for quickly refining calibration settings without restarting the QM connection.

### Limitations
⚠ **Not compatible with Octave** – If your configuration includes Octave, you must use the previous method of opening a QM.

⚠ **ports/FEMs/chassis cannot be added**  – The ports/FEMs/chassis in the controller config cannot be added.
