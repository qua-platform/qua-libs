    "## Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization used by the authors uses a [CMA-ES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES)\n",
    "optimization of the amplitudes (of both I and Q quadratures) and frequency of a [DRAG pulse](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.0534.pdf), where the cost function is \n",
    "evaluated via a randomized benchmarking (RB) procedure. \n",
    "\n",
    "RB is a useful technique to estimate the fidelity of quantum operations by creating a\n",
    "random circuit of cliffords. The random circuit is \n",
    "followed by an operation to recover the system to the ground state. The final step of this procedure \n",
    "is a measurement which, after multiple realizations, gives an average figure of merit for the fidelity of \n",
    "all operations performed on the qubit. A randomized benchmarking procedure script is available on the QM Libraries repo on GitHub, and is repeated almost \n",
    "without changes here. \n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal pulse obtained is then used as a starting point for an optimization step with more degrees of freedom.\n",
    "In this second step, each sample of the I and Q components of the DRAG pulse is allowed to be modified by a weight vector $\\delta_n$. \n",
    "This is referred to as a _piecewise constant pulse_ (PWC). With these added degrees of freedom, the optimization is run again to obtain the final optimized pulse. \n",
    "In the paper, fidelity is calculated for different pulse durations (as a free parameter rather than an optimization parameter) to final an ideal duration. \n",

    "## QUA Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The QUA side of the procedure outline above is performed in lr_lib.py. This file contains \n",
    "the function `get_program` which performs two operations: generation of the I,Q slowly varying envelopes needed to \n",
    "synthesize the waveforms and randomization of the RB circuit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The QUA program generated by `get_program` is run by `get_result` which runs it multiple time \n",
    "to get multiple realizations at the specified RB circuit depth. The fidelity is calculated at each \n",
    "step and an error term is returned to be used as a cost for the next optimization step. \n"
